## Ready to create the future?

This is the official web page of Ericsson Cognitive Labs. This is an initiative to contribute to the rest of society by making a huge amount of our research public. Our mission is to create world-class AI research that can improve our products and benefit the open-source community at the same time. Our interests are centered on cutting-edge AI technologies, such as Graph Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Active Learning or Large Language Models.

## Who we are?

Ericsson Cognitive Labs is an initiative powered by a department inside Cognitive Network Solutions (which is within the Business Area Cloud Software and Services - BCSS), called Cognitive Software Engineering. In this department, we are focused on the optimization of cellular networks using AI. If you are interested in our products please check this web page, and if what drives you here is our publications, check our publications page or our Labs and the initiatives they are pursuing.
