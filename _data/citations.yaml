  description: Explainability in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a new field growing
    in the last few years. In this publication we address the problem of determining
    how important is each neighbor for the GNN when classifying a node and how to
    measure the performance for this specific task. To do this, various known explainability
    methods are reformulated to get the neighbor importance and four new metrics are
    presented. Our results show that there is almost no difference between the explanations
    provided by gradient-based techniques in the GNN domain. In addition, many explainability
    techniques failed to identify important neighbors when GNNs without self-loops
    are used.

  title: Model Uncertainty based Active Learning on Tabular Data using Boosted Trees

  description: Supervised machine learning relies on the availability of good labelled
    data for model training. Labelled data is acquired by human annotation, which
    is a cumbersome and costly process, often requiring subject matter experts. Active
    learning is a sub-field of machine learning which helps in obtaining the labelled
    data efficiently by selecting the most valuable data instances for model training
    and querying the labels only for those instances from the human annotator. Recently,
    a lot of research has been done in the field of active learning, especially for
    deep neural network based models. Although deep learning shines when dealing with
    image\textual\multimodal data, gradient boosting methods still tend to achieve
    much better results on tabular data. In this work, we explore active learning
    for tabular data using boosted trees. Uncertainty based sampling in active learning
    is the most commonly used querying strategy, wherein the labels of those instances
    are sequentially queried for which the current model prediction is maximally uncertain.
    Entropy is often the choice for measuring uncertainty. However, entropy is not
    exactly a measure of model uncertainty. Although there has been a lot of work
    in deep learning for measuring model uncertainty and employing it in active learning,
    it is yet to be explored for non-neural network models. To this end, we explore
    the effectiveness of boosted trees based model uncertainty methods in active learning.
    Leveraging this model uncertainty, we propose an uncertainty based sampling in
    active learning for regression tasks on tabular data. Additionally, we also propose
    a novel cost-effective active learning method for regression tasks along with
    an improved cost-effective active learning method for classification tasks.
